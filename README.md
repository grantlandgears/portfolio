## Hello world :)

## In here are the projects I've worked on.  They are all mostly focused on data analysis and science.
## Modeling is of course very exciting to see that final prediction, but I find I really enjoy the EDA portion.  Searching through the data, learning about it, cleaning, prepping, plumbing, etc...  I like that part.  Makes me feel better about my models when I know the data is sound.
